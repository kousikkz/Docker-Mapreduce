Docker can package an application and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any Linux, Windows, or macOS computer. This enables the application to run in a variety of locations, such as on-premises, in public (see decentralized computing, distributed computing, and cloud computing) or private cloud.[11] When running on Linux, Docker uses the resource isolation features of the Linux kernel (such as cgroups and kernel namespaces) and a union-capable file system (such as OverlayFS)[12] to allow containers to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines.[13] Docker on macOS uses a Linux virtual machine to run the containers.[14]

Because Docker containers are lightweight, a single server or virtual machine can run several containers simultaneously.[15] A 2018 analysis found that a typical Docker use case involves running eight containers per host, and that a quarter of analyzed organizations run 18 or more per host.[16]

The Linux kernel's support for namespaces mostly[17] isolates an application's view of the operating environment, including process trees, network, user IDs and mounted file systems, while the kernel's cgroups provide resource limiting for memory and CPU.[18] Since version 0.9, Docker includes its own component (called "libcontainer") to use virtualization facilities provided directly by the Linux kernel, in addition to using abstracted virtualization interfaces via libvirt, LXC and systemd-nspawn.[19][10][11][20]

Docker implements a high-level API to provide lightweight containers that run processes in isolation.[21] Docker containers are standard processes, so it is possible to use kernel features to monitor their executionâ€”including for example the use of tools like strace to observe and intercede with system calls.[22]
Software: The Docker daemon, called dockerd, is a persistent process that manages Docker containers and handles container objects. The daemon listens for requests sent via the Docker Engine API.[23][24] The Docker client program, called docker, provides a command-line interface (CLI), that allows users to interact with Docker daemons.[23][25]
Objects: Docker objects are various entities used to assemble an application in Docker. The main classes of Docker objects are images, containers, and services.[23]
A Docker container is a standardized, encapsulated environment that runs applications.[26] A container is managed using the Docker API or CLI.[23]
A Docker image is a read-only template used to build containers. Images are used to store and ship applications.[23]
A Docker service allows containers to be scaled across multiple Docker daemons. The result is known as a swarm, a set of cooperating daemons that communicate through the Docker API.[23]
Registries: A Docker registry is a repository for Docker images. Docker clients connect to registries to download ("pull") images for use or upload ("push") images that they have built. Registries can be public or private. The main public registry is Docker Hub. Docker Hub is the default registry where Docker looks for images.[23][27] Docker registries also allow the creation of notifications based on events.[28]
